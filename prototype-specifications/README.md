# Prototype specifications

## Why a prototype?

After the first iteration of DFC Standard building, we chose to directly develop a prototype in order to use this standard in a concrete example, including an interaction the platforms of our partners. This helped \(and is still helping\) us a lot to improve the stanrdard over iterations as there are always some small differences between theoritical design and experimental applications. To get quickly this feedback allows us to adjust our specifications with real cases, and this is why we also want to share these informations in this book.

Thus we will focus on:

* [Design decisions](design-decisions.md) made to build the protoype following the standars
* [Prototype strategy](prototype-strategy.md) showing the planning for next development iteration
* [Status of the project](status-of-the-project.md) to

If you are more interested into the code and his usage, you will find all you need in the next section.

## API Data Format

The data frames we deisgned evolved during the developement and you can find the different versions in [Appendix 2 - Practical Examples](../appendixes/practical-examples/).

The current recommenced format is the [version 1.4](../appendixes/practical-examples/version-1-4.md).

## Access to code source

To access the code source of DFC Prototype, we are suggesting you to take a look a our Github project: [DFC Prototype](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3).

You can find more details at the wiki section: [https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3/wiki](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3/wiki). It will help you to install the protoype, to use it, and to connect your application to it if you wish it.
