# Status and roadmap

We needed to start working on the prototype to build a first version of the technical standard, understand the current status of the data and of the first platforms willing to adopt the standard. We built a prototype on the use case of sharing of products catalogs between platforms and mutualization of logistic flows.

This prototype is developed in several steps:  
**1- Producers can read their catalog in a unique place and see what they propose to each of the platforms they are publishing data to.** Before going further and talk about products transportation, we need to make sure the ontology enable us to correctly manage products information between platforms.

**2- Producers can make action on their catalog other than reading \(creating, updating, deleting products\)  
  
3 - Producers will be able to see, beyond their cross-platforms catalog, their orders  
  
4 - Same but with logistic flows**

You can see the real time progress of the development of the POC through this [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/projects/1).
