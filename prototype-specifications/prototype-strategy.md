# Prototype strategy

The strategy we have undertaken for building the first step of the prototype is the following :

1- First the producer will be able to "import" their catalog from one or multiple "sources", platforms where they have already uploaded a catalog. They will be able to solve "conflicts" as it's very likely information will diverge from one platform to the other. Doing that, they are merging their catalog to obtain a digital catalog that will somehow be the "single point of truth", the place they will be able to update information, etc.

2- The second step will be for the platforms to adapt their code to be able to read from that catalog, ie to read data that are not in their own silo. This can be done through different technical strategies that we will explore at that stage \(synchronizations / web component base direct reading in the source catalog, etc.\)
