# Prototype strategy

The strategy we have undertaken for building the first step of the prototype is the following :

1- First the producer will be able to "import" their catalog from one or multiple "sources", platforms where they have already uploaded a catalog. They will be able to solve "conflicts" as it's very likely information will diverge from one platform to the other. Doing that, they are "reunifying" their catalog and will obtain a digital catalog that will somehow be the "single point of truith", the place they will be able to update information, etc.

2. The second step will be for the platforms to adapt to be able to read from that reunified catalog, so to read data that are not in their own silo. That can be done through different technical strategies that we will explore at that stage \(synchronizations / web component base direct reading in the source catalog, etc.\)

3- For that we need unique identifiers for products, and as explained precedently, we have chosen to use Open Food Facts identifiers for that, to increase accessibility of the services to all producers \(even if not GS1 customers\) and make it easier for producers to open their data on Open Food Facts if they want.
