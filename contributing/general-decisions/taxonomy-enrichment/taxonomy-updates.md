# Taxonomy updates

The procedure for releasing updates to the taxon files is detailed below:

1. Initial changes are submitted to [vocBench](https://vocbench.datafoodconsortium.org/vocbench3/#/Home).
2. Changes are approved & merged by a project administrator
3. Updated JSON-LD and RDF files are generated by export from vocBench
4. Updated files are pushed to the [github repository](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/taxonomies/tree/nextTaxon), on the `nextTaxon` branch.
5. Reviews are completed and the updated files are merged into the `main` branch.
6. Following the appropriate flow (determined by whether it's a Patch, Minor, or Major Release)
7. A new release is generated and updated JSON-LD and RDF files are published to the latest release folder for the contexts to read.
