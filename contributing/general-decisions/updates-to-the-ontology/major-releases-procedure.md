# Major releases procedure

A major release consists of significant changes, that are not backwards compatible (i.e. breaking changes).

A major release must be reviewed and signed off by at least 2 members of the ontology team.

All partner platforms will be notified through their contact email. Platforms must respond confirming acceptance of the release before proceeding to public notification.&#x20;

A major release will then be publicly notified (a minimum of 10 days in advance of release) by broadcast on Slack & Github.
