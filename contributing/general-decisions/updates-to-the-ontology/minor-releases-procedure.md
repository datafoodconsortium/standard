# Minor releases procedure

A minor release consists of minor enhancements to files, that are entirely backwards compatible.

A minor release must be reviewed and signed off by at least 2 members of the ontology team.

All partner platforms will be notified through their contact email. Platforms will be given 3 working days to respond.

A patch release will then be notified (a minimum of 7 days in advance of release) by broadcast on Slack & Github.
