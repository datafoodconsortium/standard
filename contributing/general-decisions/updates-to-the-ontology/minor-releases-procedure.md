# Minor releases procedure

A minor release consists of minor enhancements to files, that are entirely backwards compatible.

A minor release is expected to follow these steps:

1. A Pull Request is created from its release branch and _MUST_ be reviewed and signed off by at least 2 members of the ontology team.
2. A pre-release is created from the release branch.
3. All partner platforms are notified via the Releases mailing list. Platforms will be given 3 working days (excluding weekends & public holidays in all participating countries) to test and respond. Any changes/fixes required will be applied to the release branch and the pre-release updated.
4. After the pre-release testing period, the Pull Request will then be merged into the master branch and the release branch deleted.
5. The minor release will then be notified (a minimum of 5 calendar days in advance of release) by broadcast on Slack (through the #releases channel) and GitHub.
6. After the appropriate notice period, the release will be marked as "Latest Release"
7. A final mail will be sent to the Release Mailing List confirming completion of the release.
