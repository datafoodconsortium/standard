# Patch releases procedure

A patch release is a simple bug fix or fixes, that are entirely backwards compatible.

A patch release must be reviewed and signed off by at least 1 member of the Ontology team.

All partner platforms will be notified through their contact email. Platforms will be given 1 working day to respond with any comments/concerns on the release.

A patch release will then be notified (a minimum of 24 hours in advance of release) by broadcast on Slack & Announcement on Github.

After the appropriate notice period, the release will be marked as "Latest Release"
