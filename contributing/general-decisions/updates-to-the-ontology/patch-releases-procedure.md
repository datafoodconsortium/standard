# Patch releases procedure

A patch release is a simple bug fix or fixes, that are entirely backwards compatible.

A patch release must be reviewed and signed off by at least 1 member of the Ontology team.

At this point a pre-release will be created from the release branch.

All partner platforms will be notified via the Releases mailing list. Platforms will be given 1 working day (excluding weekends & public holidays in all participating countries) to test & respond.

Any changes/fixes required will be applied to the release branch & the pre-release updated.

After the pre-release testing period, the release branch will then be merged into the master branch & the release branch deleted.

A patch release will then be notified (a minimum of 24 hours in advance of release) by broadcast on Slack (through the #releases channel) & Announcement on Github.

After the appropriate notice period, the release will be marked as "Latest Release"\
\
A final mail will be sent to the Release Mailing List confirming completion of the release.
