# ðŸš§ Procedures

We are using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Update the ontology

Our ontology describes the data concepts & relationships between them that our standard uses to describe the short supply chain ecosystem. The ontology files are written in Web Ontology Language (OWL) and also expressed in RDF/XML.

See the [dedicated section](updates-to-the-ontology/).

## Update the taxonomies

The Taxonomy files hold the various (SKOS compliant) hierarchies & reference lists used within the ontology. The Taxon files are expressed in JSON-LD and RDF/XML.

See the [dedicated section](taxonomy-enrichment/).
