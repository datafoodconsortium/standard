# Authentication strategy

In order to manage authentication, we decide to support the [OpenID protocol](https://openid.net/connect/) which is a layer on top of [OAuth2 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/).

This technology is active since years and heavily supported by many big actors of the Web.

It will allow us to separate the authentication layer from the business logic one by calling a third-party application.
