# Decentralised identifier matching reference system

DFC choose to not centralized an unique identifier reference system for catalog product nor all other subject. We could use Open Food Fact or GS1 reference system but both have come up against political or technical problems. DFC provide a mediation intermediary to deal identifier matching between platforms. Prototype provide this feature as open source and it is free to use.
