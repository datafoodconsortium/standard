# Technical specifications

## General principles

Here you will find the core of this book, focusing on how to build the DFC standard.

The main objective of the DFC standard is to allow different platforms to easily read and write data from each other, in an authentifed way and using existing standards.

We divided this chapter into 4 parts:

* [Protocols specifications](protocols-specifications.md) where we will list the existing protocols we are using to build our semantic model, the core of our interoperability engine.
* [Decentralized identifier matching reference system](decentralised-identifier-matching-reference-system.md) where we will explain why we are not building a centralized referential but rather promoting platforms intermedation.
* [Authentication strategy](authentication-strategy.md) where we will discuss the use of OpenID protocol as our authentication layer.
* [Architecture representations](architecture-representations.md) where we will finally resume all these information into a nice schema.

## Decisions and choices history

As we are documenting most of design decisions and choices, you can find them in the appendixes:

* [Appendix 1 - General decisions](../appendixes/general-decisions/)
* [Appendix 2 - Technical decisions](../appendixes/technical-decisions/).

## About the DFC Prototype

In order to give an example of the standard implementation, and especially the intermediation logic behind our interoperability model, we have developed the [DFC Prototype](../prototype-specifications/) that you will discover more in the next chapter.
