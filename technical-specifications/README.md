# Technical specifications

Here you will find the core of this book, focusing on how to build our strong standard.

We divided this in 5 parts:

* [General principles](general-principles.md)
* [Authentication strategy](authentication-strategy.md)
* [Decentralized identifier matching reference system](decentralised-identifier-matching-reference-system.md)
* [Protocols specifications](protocols-specifications.md)
* [Architecture representations](architecture-representations.md)

## Decisions and choices history

As we are documenting most of design decisions and choices, you can find them in the appendixes:
* [Appendix 1 - General decisions](../appendixes/general-decisions/)
* [Appendix 2 - Technical decisions](../appendixes/technical-decisions/).
