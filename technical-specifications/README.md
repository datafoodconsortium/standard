# Technical specifications

Here you will find the core of this book, focusing on how to build our strong standard.

We divided this in 3 parts:

* [General principles](general-principles.md)
* [Authentication strategy](authentication-strategy.md)
* [Architecture representations](architecture-representations.md)

## Decisions and choices history

As we are documenting most of design decisions and choices, you can find them in the appendixes:
* [Appendix 1 - Decisions and choices history](../appendixes/general-decisions/)
* [Appendix 1 - Decisions and choices history](../appendixes/technical-decisions/).
