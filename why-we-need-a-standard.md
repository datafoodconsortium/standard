# Why we need a standard?

### The problems are:

* Multiple duplication of production information by producers, and inability to seamlessly manage stock
* Difficulty to adopt a big data approach and build new services due to data incompatibility \(ex: logistics\)

### The objective is:

* To enable producers to seamlessly manage their product and inventory catalog while selling their products through multiple channels using multiple platforms.
* To enable the development of shared logistics solutions using logistic information from all the platforms in use.
* To allow the implementation of interoperable management tools allowing for example a producer to generate integrated reports gathering sales data from different platforms
* To allow the reporting or visualization \(via maps for instance\) of data coming from multiple platforms.
* To allow actors with different business models and technologies to work together without changing their way of working and tools.
* Etc.

### For this we need:

* That the data follows a shared semantic standard so that it can be shared from one actor to another even if the actors have different data models, speak different languages.
* To be able to link the data to unique identifiers allowing their reconciliation when necessary \(eg unique product identifier, unique company identifier, unique person identifier, unique place identifier\)
* An architecture allowing this ecosystem to work in a decentralized manner, including the areas of identification/authentication, segmentation of the API on high or low granularity service logic, etc.
