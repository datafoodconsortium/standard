# Status of the project

### First releases

We released in November 2017 a first version of the semantic standard, then a second version in June 2018, and we just released a new version in May 2019.  You can access the corresponding ontology through [Github](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/ontology). For the technical specification, we started to work on it in october 2018 and we just released a first specification through this document.

### The POC to test the v.0 of the standard

We needed to start working on the prototype to build a first version of the technical standard, understand the current status of the data and of the first platforms willing to adopt the standard. We built a prototype on the use case of sharing of products catalogs between platforms and mutualization of logistic flows.

This prototype will be developed in 3 steps:  
**1- Producers can access their universal catalog and visualize what they propose to each of their distribution channels.** Before going further and talk about products transportation, we need to make sure the ontology enable us to correctly manage products information between platforms.

**2- Producers will be able to see, beyond their cross-platforms catalog, logistic flows planned whatever their distribution channel.**

3- Producers will be able to define some filters to display compatible logistics flows from other producers within the ecosystem using the same standard.

We have now specified more precisely [the UX of the first step of the prototype](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MhV4M47wFw5e1UadvB0M3RLQN7FPH3Iz) \(document in French\). And already it raises a lot of questions, about synchronization of data for example : when a producer has connected and imported data from various platforms, solved conflicts, etc. If he modifies a data in one platform, and make another change for the same product in another one, etc. How do we synchronize ? For now we don’t have platforms reading and updating info from a universal shared catalog. We don’t know yet how we are going to manage such issues, but we’ll move forward one step at a time !

You can see the real time progress of the development of the POC through this [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/projects/1).

So developing this prototype will enable us to test real life the semantic specification of the standard \(the ontology\) and the technical specifications \(the protocols, etc.\) described below, and improve them step by step.
