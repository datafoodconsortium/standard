# Federation vs Syndication

The nuance between syndication and federation applies to all the notions where several servers jointly concur to achieve an objective.

* Federation = all servers respect the same protocol. This facilitates interaction between the actors of the federation. But if all aspects of the protocol are federated \(including identification and authentication and admit a single reference system for business subject\). It can make access to the federation more implacable because to enter it,  All must implement the same protocol and often migrate to common servers \(authentification, identification référence system\).
* Syndication = each actor has his own protocol, which is translated into the common protocol to allow interaction. Moving the complexity to the integration layer.
* Mixed = The architecture may also be an hybrid : using common protocols \(syntax, API, ontology\) and centralized authentification  but not centralized reference system.
