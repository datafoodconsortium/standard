# Right delegation between platforms and DFC

In the prototype, there is no request for consent, but we can clearly indicate what data will be used just for information.

**For the prototype, we will use the OIDC server managed by The Commons.**

By choosing OIDC centralized authentication / identification, the user consents to DFC having access to their data when a DFC account is created and linking it to their platform account. **The right management is decentralized on the platforms that can implement their own system.**

**On the long term WACL \(Web Access Control\) should be the ideal solution for platforms that choose SOLID servers.**
