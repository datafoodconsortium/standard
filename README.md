# DFC standard documentation

The present book aims at documenting the Data Food Consortium standard, You will find context informations, and then some more details specifications about the semantic and technical standard.

This standard mainly aims at facilitating cooperation and mutualisation within a distribution food system. But the use of it can be extended, as local buying groups don't sell only food, and it seems classical distribution channels might also fit within the business model description.

Enjoy, use, share, and [join the consortium](https://datafoodconsortium.gitbook.io/dfc-standard-documentation/contact-and-partners) !
