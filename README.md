# DFC standard documentation

The present book aims at documenting the Data Food Consortium standard. You will find context information, and then some more detailed specifications about the semantic and technical standards.

This standard mainly aims at facilitating cooperation and mutualisation within the food distribution system. But the use of it can be extended, as local buying groups don't only sell food, and it seems that classical distribution channels might also fit within the business model description of the standard.

Enjoy, use, share, and [join the consortium](https://datafoodconsortium.gitbook.io/dfc-standard-documentation/contact-and-partners) !
