# DFC Standard Documentation

The present book aims at documenting the Data Food Consortium standard. You will find context information, and then some more detailed specifications about the semantic and technical standards.

This standard mainly aims at facilitating cooperation and mutualisation within the food distribution system. But the use of it can be extended, as local buying groups don't only sell food, and it seems that classical distribution channels might also fit within the business model description of the standard.

If you want to access more general information about why the Data Food Consortium, we invite you to take a look the DFC website: https://www.datafoodconsortium.org. You will understand here the objectives of the Data Food Consortium, the partners of the project, the way to contact the DFC team, ...

If you want to have more information about a concrete example of a DFC implementation, we are suggesting you to take a look a our Github project called [https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3](DFC Prototype). You can find more details at the wiki section: https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3/wiki. You will have here the codebase of an application built on the DFC standard, and how to connect your platform on it.
