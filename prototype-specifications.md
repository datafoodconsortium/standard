# Prototype specifications

## Why a prototype?

After the first iteration of the DFC Standard, we chose to develop a prototype in order to use this standard in a pratical example. This helped \(and is still helping\) us a lot to improve the standard over iterations as there are always some small differences between theoritical design and experimental applications. To get quickly this feedback allows us to adjust our specifications with real cases, and this is why we also want to share these information in this book.

## Roadmap

It follows, of course, our standard definition. You will find then the different milestones for past, present and future developement.

What we did so far is:
- Implement authentication with OIDC
- Read catalogs from different API following the DFC standard
- Link items from these different catalogs with an intuitive UI

What we are currently doing is:
- Write data on API following the DFC standard
- Improve internationalization

What we aim to is:
- Synchronize catalogs between platforms, especially on logisitic aspect
- Synchronize orders between platforms


## API Data Format

The data frames we designed evolved during the developement and you can find the different versions in [Appendix 3 - Practical Examples](../appendixes/practical-examples/).

The current recommenced format is the [version 1.5](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standarddocumentation/tree/4d0cabf44403fe90253690daed02ed8110d1b4bc/appendixes/practical-examples/version-1-5.md).

## Access to source code

To access the code source of the DFC Prototype, we are suggesting to take a look a our Github project: [DFC Prototype](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3).

You can also find technical information [here](http://static.datafoodconsortium.org/).

You can find more details at the wiki section: [https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3/wiki](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/dfc-prototype-V3/wiki). It will help you to install the protoype, to use it, and to connect your application to it if you wish.
