# Semantic specifications

## Why semantic?

The DFC Consortium chose to build the standard using semantic standards. In terms of interoperability, this approach makes totally sense and allows us to use robust technologies to complete our objectives. It is an important decision and it will help us to improve the standard in the future, and also to give us more possibility in interoperability automation.

You can find more information about this choice in this [appendix](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standarddocumentation/tree/bf798061ab399eca4ada363fa47da245908a3ae0/appendixes/decisions-and-choices-history/service-standard.html#de-facto-standards-or-semantic-web-).

## Ontologies

Semantic specifications are expressed with files called onotologies. It is using Web Ontology Language \([OWL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language)\), based on other standards such as XML and RDF.

We are actually using 3 main files \(and a fourth one to synthetise them three\):

* [Product ontology](product-ontology.md)
* [Business ontology](business-ontology.md)
* [Technical ontology](technical-ontology.md)
* Full ontology

## Access to code source

These ontologies are totally public and you can find the sources on:

* [Github](https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/ontology) which is used in order to maintain and share the source files.
* [Linked Open Vocubularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/dfc) which is a famous library helping our standard to be discovered by other people using and reusing semantic ontologies.
