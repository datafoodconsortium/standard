# Technical ontology

## Usage

This ontology allow to describe subject hosted in platform and equivalent subject hosted in an other Platform.

Links between two or more subjects can be done by a human thanks to prototype. It is the main use of the prototype and a key of interoperability.

DFC provides way to build links repository of subject hosted in platforms thanks to open source software using common Ontology and Protocol. This repository of subjects is needed to communication between platform because a platform have to know equivalent subject of his own to interact with an other platform using Protocol and Ontology.

## Concept
