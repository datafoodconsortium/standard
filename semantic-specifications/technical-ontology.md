# Technical ontology

This ontology will help to identify the products and the facets chosen to do so.

## History and references

We came up with that model through various iterations, you can especially [check that spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l0wCwerm1ZW6zkUF4uB_A8u6B-MRaY3DmKSZKK9Z0vc) illustrating the cases we used to illustrate and validate our last iteration.

## Facets

We chose to characterize products through various orthogonal facets that enable precise understanding, rich research and comparisons. This will be really useful for several use cases. They will enable platforms to order products received from automated data exchange in their own appropriate taxonomy. Also, actors will be able to make searches in a pull of products from various platforms using various custom taxonomies.
