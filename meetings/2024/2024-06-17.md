## Beckn protocol

This protocol is widely used in India (backed by the Indian government). We don't know if we can easily integrate with it. Benoit from Startin'blox is going to do a first analysis. 
Once this is done, we will define the next steps. For now, this is recorded in a draft issue here: https://github.com/orgs/datafoodconsortium/projects/5/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=67692136

## Data Capture

This is funded by FDC on a separate budget. Issue to track progress is here: https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/.github/issues/36

## W3id (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/18)

Garethe didn't have a chance yet to test with his Apache server, which he needs to set up first. If this isn't working, Garethe will ask Simon if he has a server available to test.

## WebID (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/10)

Maxime has already spend 2 days on this (which was the budget allocated so far). 
To go from the current draft version in the issue to implementation in the standard, the task is quite massive. Introducing WebID is indeed impacting the standard everywhere. 
The standard needs to be reorganized and especially be more pratical for platforms (with real use cases).

Maxime has started working on the standard v2 here: https://datafoodconsortium.gitbook.io/dfc-standard-v2/client-protocols/enterprisehttps://datafoodconsortium.gitbook.io/dfc-standard-v2/client-protocols/enterprise

We agreed the next step is for Garethe to use part of his budget for documentation to document use cases on a different branch Maxime is working on. This way, everyone will work with the same use cases. Issue is https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/29
In parallel, we need to find budget to continue work on v2 / WebID implementation. Maxime might continue working anyway as he needs this for his own platform, Mycelium.

## Modularizing ontology and version control

This topic has not progressed in ontology circle yet
