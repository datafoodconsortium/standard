## WebID and profile (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/10)

Maxime will do a demo next meeting

## Data Capture ( https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24)

A sample / mockup or even just a document would help Jamie to understand how mixins will work in the typescript semantizer. Maxime gave a link to how it is implemented so far: https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semantizer-typescript/blob/61c5ddbcde51fbc7469ac315169ac8b42a74d194/src/test/src/index.ts
Garethe and Jamie will meet this week to unblock point 2, see https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/connector-codegen/issues/24#issuecomment-2228639516

## Refresh tokens (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/39)

Garethe will move forward on implementation

## Global email address [https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/36)

We agreed with Garethe's proposal of switching main address to hello@dfc-standard.org

## NGI Search application

Maxime worked on a proposal, but it must be submited before 5PM CET today and there are elements missing (team + ressources)

Maxime and Rachel will meet after the meeting to finalize.

## UML Model Updates (https://github.com/datafoodconsortium/standard/issues/41)

This process is not documented yet. The following project can be used as an example to follow:

Maxime is using Eclipse to visualize the UML. Garethe will try this out
