## Decision on note taking

Notes are still useful for:
- listing issues to create => for this we agreed to use draft issue mode
- publish / be transparent on which topic people talked
- track participants / progress
- future meeting dates: for this we agree to mimic https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/16/views/1

Rachel will create a file for notes in the standard repository and create a view in the tech project to see next meeting dates

## Modularizing our ontology and version control

These topics are with ontology circle for now. First step is to define next version content: from there we need to check if we need a dedicated module and how we maitain versions.
