# Orders

Orders are patterns for processing the transfer of goods between actors. They can be processed and transferred immediately (e.g. a sale at a market stall) or there can be a delay whilst goods are prepared, packed and/or dispatched (e.g. an online veg box order).

All Orders happen within a Sales Session (the Farmers Market, or an Order Cycle for an online platform). The Order requires a Customer (an Actor linked by the `dfc-b:OrderedBy` relationship)

The status of the Order is defined by 3 States - `OrderState`, `PaymentState` & `FulfillmentState`. These are further enumerated & explained in the relevant section.
