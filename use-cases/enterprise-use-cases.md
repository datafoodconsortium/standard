  \
  Enterprise profile data, esp. when combined with WebId, allow Enterprises to publish details of their location, contact info & key personnel\

* As a Producer Enterprise I need to be able to restrict who can access my data (including Product catalog's, Location, contact details),  and authorize individual users to carry out operations on my data: e.g. place Orders, update product data (stock, price, image etc) so that I can ensure my data sovereignty is preserved.\

  User access is controlled via OpenID Connect authentication.  \

* As a Producer Enterprise I need to be able to specify my default trade terms  (e.g. account terms, delivery windows, lead-times & distribution areas) so that prospective customers can clearly see what the terms of business are when working with me, and whether it is logistically possible for me to supply them.\
