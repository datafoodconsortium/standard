# What is the DFC standard?

The DFC standard is composed of 2 complementary blocks:

1- a semantic block which is a unified and agreed upon sectoral activity description, presented both in a human \(model\) and machine \(ontology\) readable format.
This description can be modularized : in the case of DFC, we have separated the “business part” \(what we do, how, who, where\) and the “product part” \(how to describe the nature of the things manipulated in the model\) and have joined them in a “full model and ontology”. This is the “common language” that enable the actors using the platforms to communicate.

2- a technical specification on how data should be exchanged between actors implementing the standard. This is the technical language that enable platforms to communication \(= share or mutualize data\).
