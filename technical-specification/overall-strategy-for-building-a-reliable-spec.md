# Overall strategy for building a reliable spec

The overall strategy is to implement the prototype in roughly two phases:

* Phase 1: implementing an MVP of the prototype, to showcase the potential of the project and help raise additional funds.
* Phase 2: the full implementation of the prototype. It will complete phase 1 to enable industrialization and professionalization of the standard through improvement of the tools, of the technical architecture, and of the possibilities of integration with external actors.
