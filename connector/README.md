# ðŸš§ Connector

The DFC connector is a tool designed to help developers to implement the DFC standard in their applications as they don't need any particular semantic web skills. It takes the form of a library providing data conforming to the DFC ontology and taxonomies.

Like applications are developed in different programming languages, we provide the connector in several programming languages. Instead of making these versions by hand (which would be a huge effort), we are generating them thanks to a source code generator.

The source code generator takes a UML model as input and produce valid ready-to-run source code as output.

The following pages specify the connector tool chain:
